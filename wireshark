# Wireshark

 Install package:
 
 1. yum install wireshark
 2. cat /etc/fedora-release
 
 First, ensure the required packages are installed:
 
 3. rpm -qa | grep -i wireshark
 
 If the Wireshark package is installed, check whether the TShark utility is installed and, if so, which version:
 
 4. tshark -v
 
 Find network devices available to TShark

 Before TShark can analyze packets, it needs to capture those packets. Network packets are processed via a network interface card (NIC) on servers, workstations,   or desktops or a WiFi card on laptops.
 
 To identify what network devices are available to TShark:
 
 5. sudo tshark -D
 
 Command to view all network interfaces on a system:
 
 6. ifconfig -a or ip addr show (use anyone)
 
 For a specific interface command is:
 
 7. ifconfig <interface-name>
 
 Start capturing some packets:
 
 8. sudo tshark -i <interface-name>
 
 limit the number of packets captured and displayed on the screen using the -c:
 
 9. sudo tshark -i <interface-name> -c 100
